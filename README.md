## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Automation Scripts
```javascript
// Example: Batch install APKs
const automation = new DeviceAutomation(deviceController);
const results = await automation.batchInstallApks(deviceId, [
    '/path/to/app1.apk',
    '/path/to/app2.apk'
]);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor device performance for 60 seconds
const metrics = await automation.monitorPerformance(deviceId, 60000);
console.log('CPU Usage:', metrics.summary.cpu.avg);
```

### Custom Automation
```javascript
// Automated app testing
const testActions = [
    { type: 'tap', x: 500, y: 1000 },
    { type: 'swipe', x1: 300, y1: 800, x2: 300, y2: 400 },
    { type: 'text', text: 'Hello World' }
];
await automation.testApp(deviceId, 'com.example.app', testActions);
```
