# possible-roadmap.md

> Oversized agent backlog for `jtgsystems/Phone-Control-Project`. This file intentionally contains 500 candidate roadmap items so bots always have something to pick up.

## How To Read This
- This is not a committed plan. It is a high-volume opportunity map inferred from the current repo shape.
- The file is split into 10 sections with 50 items each so work can be sliced by area instead of one giant queue.
- Promote, rewrite, or delete items after real repo verification.

## Basis
